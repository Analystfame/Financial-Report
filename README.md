## **Revenue Analytics**  
I conducted a thorough horizontal analysis to determine the year-over-year percentage growth in revenue. By examining historical sales data, I calculated the average growth rate, which I then utilized to forecast revenue growth over the next four years. This method not only provided valuable insights into past performance but also established a reliable basis for projecting future revenue trends, enabling strategic planning and informed decision-making.


## **Finance Analytics**
I developed a comprehensive financial model to analyze key metrics, ensuring that all calculations adhered to the fundamental accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity). Key components of the analysis included:

- **Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement**: Assessed revenue, costs, and expenses to determine net income and profitability.
- **Cash Flow Statement**: Evaluated cash inflows and outflows to understand liquidity and operational efficiency.
- **Balance Sheet**: Analyzed assets, liabilities, and equity to ensure financial stability and compliance with the accounting equation.
- **Key Metrics**: Focused on Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Margin, and Gross Margin Percentage to derive actionable insights.

This structured approach allowed for informed decision-making and effective strategic financial planning.
